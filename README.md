# Tesla-Stock-Prediction-Beta-Version-

This Code is still a work in progress. The code is meant to predict future tesla stock prices based on 2 inputs; the opening price and Lowest price of the stock. 
The codes is mainly a Linear Regression algorithm, which is not the best aproach to this situation, but it works just fine to predict the closing price of the stock.
